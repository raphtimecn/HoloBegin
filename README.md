# HoloBegin
Beginners to Advanced on HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality

Start date 28th April 2017. Update date 28th April 
The purpose of this documentation and examples is to allow new and updated information to be displayed
The main problem with Tutorials and documentation on forums is that they cannot be updated you have 24 hours to correct or add updates

This repository (repo) will allow a central place to store new and updates to the HoloLens development environment.

Mostly this will save me forgetting how to do somehting and have to relearn the procedure
Most of all this will be a place to share information with everyone

GitHub have these wonderful feedback controls and update controls, meaning anyone can log problems
